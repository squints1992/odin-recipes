        <p>
            Menudo can be considered a delicacy. It is the stomach lining of a cow many people can be <br>
            put off by it because of its texture, it can be very chewy. If cooked correctly it melts in <br>
            in your mouth and very flavorfull. If you can get passed the texture you will not <br>
            regret it. After a heavy night of drinking it is a great hang over food. I hope you enjoy!
